# WhatsApp Clone (Working Group Chat Application)

Hi, I have made another build using React, which is a whatsapp clone but I choose to make it simpler and trying to make all feature works fine.

This project is using:

- NPM
- React, react router dom and state provider
- Material UI
- [Random profile API](https://avatars.dicebear.com/)
- Firebase (Hosting, FireStore, auth)

## Started on 15 September 2020

### Next feature

- Persistent login(refresh not logged out)
- Delete Button still buggy (done by [kafinsalim]("https://github.com/kafinsalim"))
- Logout Button instead of refresh
- Working search feature
- Emoticon working
- More styling

### Live

- [Firebase Hosting](https://whatsapp-clone-sam23.web.app/)
